## :pushpin: About
This project is a cash flow manager that allows the user to insert and remove financial transactions, keeping the final balance updated according to cash inflows and outflows.

## ⚙️ Backend
The system's **backend** was developed in `JAVA`, using the `Spring Framework`, and the application's package management was done with `Maven`.

## 🖥️ Frontend
The **frontend** was developed using `HTML`, `Tailwind`, `React` and `NextJS` with `Typescript`. To build the interface, `Shadcn-ui` was also used as a library.
